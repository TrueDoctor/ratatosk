### Motivation
You might have heard of a game called Nidhogg. The aim of this project is to provide a similar game accessible through the web.

### Implementation details
The game is written in the programming language [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). On the frontend we use [Web Assembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) so we can also use Rust on the frontend.
